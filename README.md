This repository contains a sentiment analysis project focused on public sentiment regarding the Israel-Palestine war. The analysis was performed using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which is well-known for its state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing tasks.

Key Features
Model: BERT was fine-tuned for sentiment classification.
Dataset: Due to the scarcity of relevant data, the analysis was performed on a limited dataset, emphasizing the importance of efficient model generalization.
Objective
The project aims to provide insights into the polarities of public sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) during the conflict, showcasing the capability of BERT to handle small, domain-specific datasets effectively.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for similar sentiment analysis tasks.

How to Use?
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/madihanazir/Sentiment-Analysis.git

Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the training and evaluation scripts to reproduce the results.
